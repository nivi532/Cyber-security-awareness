        <p class="v5_36">ABOUT CYBER THREATS</p>
        <div class="v5_35">
            Ever heard of cybersecurity threat?
            It's the threat of malicious attack by an individual or organization attempting to gain access to a network,
            to corrupt data or steal confidential information or any other form of sensitive data.
            A successful cyber attack can ruin your years of hardwork and career. Cyber threats can come from within an
            organization by trusted users or from remote locations by unknown parties and who knows, it maybe the person
            next to you!
            Former Cisco CEO John Chambers once said, “There are two types of companies: those that have been hacked,
            and those who don’t yet know they have been hacked.”
            Cyber attacks hit businesses every day.
            So, what do you think cyberattacking is ? Is it just hacking into your system?
            Not at all. Cyberattacks are much more than hacking just to be termed that.

            new to this part of the world and just starting out,this is the great place to start with.Our vision is to

            Ransomware is a file encryption software program that uses a unique robust encryption algorithm to encrypt
            the files on the target system.
            The authors of the Ransomware threat generate a unique decryption key for each of its victims and save it in
            a remote server. Thus, users cannot access their files by any application.
            The ransomware authors take advantage of this and demand a considerable ransom amount from the victims to
            provide the decryption code or decrypt the data. But such attacks have any guarantee of recovery of data
            even after paying the ransom.

            Botnets was initially designed to carry out a specific tasks within a group.

            botnet

            It is defined as a network or group of devices connected with the same network to execute a task. But this
            is now being used by bad actors and hackers that attempts to access the network and inject any malicious
            code or malware to disrupt its working. Some of the botnet attacks include:

            Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks
            Spreading spam emails
            Stealing of confidential data
            Botnets attacks are generally carried out against large-scale businesses and organization due to its huge
            data access. Through this attack, the hackers can control a large number of devices and compromise them for
            its evil motives.

            criminals to gather user’s sensitive information. social-engineering It may trick you by displaying
            attractive advertisements, prizes, huge offers and so and ask you to feed your personal and bank account
            details. All the information you enter there is cloned and used for financial frauds, identity frauds and
            so. It is worth saying about the ZEUS virus that is active since 2007 and is being used as a social
            engineering attack methods to steal banking details of the victims. Along with financial losses, Social
            engineering attacks are capable of downloading other destructive threats to the concerned
            system.</span><span class="v5_43">Cryptocurrency Hijacking

                As the digital currency and mining are becoming popular, so it is among cyber criminals. They have found their evil benefit to the crypto-currency mining which involves complex computing to mine virtual currency like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero, Litecoin so on.
                
                Cryptocurrency investors and traders are the soft target for this attack.
                
                Cryptocurrency hijacking also known as “Cryptojacking”. It is a program designed to inject mining codes silently to the system. Thus the hacker silently uses the CPU, GPU and power resources of the attacked system to mine for the cryptocurrency.
                
                The technique is used to particularly mine Monero coins. As the mining is a complex process, it consumes most of the CPU resources which impacts the system’s performance. Also, it is done under all your expenses, so the victim may get ha huge electricity bill and internet bill.
                
                It also lessens the lifespan of the affected device.</span>
